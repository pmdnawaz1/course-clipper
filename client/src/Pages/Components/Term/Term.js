                        To post a review, comment on, like, or flag a review, or undertake any other action on our
                        platform (excluding browsing), you must first create a user account. You are allowed to create
                        only one user account, which is personal and non-transferable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creating a user account typically involves signing in to the platform using your Facebook or
                        Google account or providing your email address along with the verification code, which we will
                        send to you. Sometimes, your account may be automatically generated and pre-filled with your
                        name, such as when you click on a review invitation after purchasing a product or using a
                        service, or when signing up via Facebook.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, you will need to select a username that will be visible on the platform whenever you
                        write a review, comment on a review, or contribute user-generated content, including reviews,
                        images, or other content created by or originating from you on the platform. Your username
                        serves as your identifier. Please note that if you use your real name as your username, your
                        identity may be revealed. Your username must not contain:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anything harmful, hateful, discriminatory, defamatory, obscene, or illegal.</li>

                                You must not permit any other individual to access or use your user account, and you should
                                refrain from sharing your login details, including your email address and verification code, with
                                anyone else. If you suspect that any of your user account login details have been stolen or
